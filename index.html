        <p class="Our-Story-P">We are the ultimate creators for Bear technology and lifestyle. Opened in 2014, Blueberri has been inovating every aspect of Bear life since then. Originally releasing the BearTop mega laptop, Blueberri set the stage for what was to come for years. Often compared to Apple, we accept the challenge to become the Apple to all of bear kind. Come together and celebrate Bear life, the Blueberri way.</p>
        <p class="Our-Story-P">Started in NorthNorthEast Colorado. Blueberri knows Bears and it knows tech. Our founder James D. Willaflacker, created this vision in 1987 with hopes to serve bears that have wasted years in traveling circuses. The horrific accident of Willy's Wildlife Tango Circus in 1972 stay engrained within Mr. Willaflacker's life. He vowed to do right by bears.</p>
